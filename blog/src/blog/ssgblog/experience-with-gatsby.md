make the effort and populate the empty starter tempalte, it will be wort it in the end.
gatsby is a very opiniated framework so using a fancy starter template will use components you are not familiar and add alot of bloat with plugins and functionality you dont intend to use

## Pros

* JAM stack, we all love to learn a new stack
* JAvascript both backend with node and frontend with reactjs
* Markdown support making adding content very easy
* you can choose exactly the components you like yourself
* very fast general purpose website
* when you have made one website with your favorite components, it is very easy to copy this to the next project
* grapql is cool
* having jslint on your written content is pretty cool
* Extremely easy deployment and can be hosted anywhere

## Cons

* Gatsby is difficult, very difficult.
* the site is static, so you need to create pages with graphql to mimic dynamic data
* need a gatsby plugin wrapping regular node packages(because the way things are packaged together)
* files are named 53523564564325234.png which can sometimes be a bit confusing
* To add new content you need to be a developer or a very technical end user
